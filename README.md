# Chess-Timer
A timer for your friendly chess games


1. Select amount of time for your game (1 to 59 minutes) and press enter.
2. When you're ready press the start icon and White will start its countdown.
3. When White finishes His/Her play press the Respective Timer and the countdown changes to the Black side. So on and so forth.
4. If any of the timers reaches 00:00 an alert with the winner is displayed.
5. Close the alert and you can start from step 1 again!

I hope this is helpful and easy to use. Have fun playing!
