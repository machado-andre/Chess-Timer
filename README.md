# Chess-Timer
A timer for your friendly chess games


1. Select ammount of time for your game (1 to 59 minutes) and press enter.
2. When you're ready press the start icon and White will start its countdown.
3. When White finishes His/Her play press her timer and the countdown changes to the Black side. So on and so forth.
4. If any of the timers reach 0 an alert with the winner is displayed.
5. Close the alert and you can start from step 1 again!

I hope this is helpful and easy to use. Have fun playing!
